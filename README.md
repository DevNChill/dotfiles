These are my dotfiles . Many of them are inspired but i tweaked them as per my need . In updating script replace the dir path and username with your username and directory path to avoid unneccesary complications.
You are free to use it :)
If you just wan't to use the nvim config , follow the steps below

```
1. git clone https://github.com/DevNChill/dotfiles
2. cd dotfiles
3. chmod +x nviminstall.sh
4. ./nviminstall.sh

```
